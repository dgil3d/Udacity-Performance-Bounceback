Final Scene: Scene0_optimized

11/8/2017 Update: Object pooling now works as desired. I found a new approach to the functions that really worked out.  Thank you for the feedback!

I believe the trampoline challenge has been optimized to the required specifications.  I've tested this scene with a standalone build as well as in the editor and achieved 90+ FPS even when there were several dozen objects in view.

Thank you for your feedback!
